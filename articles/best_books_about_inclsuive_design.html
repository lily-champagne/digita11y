            <h2>What Can a Body Do? How We Meet the Designed World </h2>
            <h3 class="author">Sara Hendren</h3>

            <p>Sarah Hendren is a designer who wrote a book about her experiences as a professor. She tells stories of the objects that have been designed in her class such as a lectern for a woman of small stature. While telling her stories, she explores the idea of what it means for something to be accessible and how people interact with objects. She wants the reader to think of everyday objects like forks as assistive devices. Although this book isn't about inclusive web design, this is a thoughtful book about how the design process can include everyone. </p>

            <h2>Inclusive Components </h2>
            <h3 class="author">Heydon Pickering</h3>
            <p>This is a technical guide for people who want to learn how to code in an inclusive way. Pickering mentions several times that he is not a computer scientist, but a person who loves computers and wanted to learn how to code. He says that writers are best at HTML and designers are the best at CSS. Each chapter gives an explanation on how to create inclusive web components such as toggle buttons, theme switchers and data tables. He also will talk about common misconceptions about inclusive code throughout the chapters as well. This book will serve as a guide to help me create my website about web inclusivity and give me inspiration for the content on the site.</p>
